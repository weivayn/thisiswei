      <description>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.
We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at The Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&amp;rsquo;s omelette.</description>

      <description>I am always a big fan of Philippine cuisine, which has similar flavor as Chinese, Spanish and Malaysian cuisines. Dishes ranges from fried fish, whole roasted pig to halo-halo. Since our car maintenance place, Firestone Complete Auto Care, is very close to Journal Square in Jersey City, my husband and I always stop by at least one Filipino restaurant while waiting.
Our usual go-to-spot is Philippine Bread House. There are actually two separate restaurants/shops in the store front.</description>

      <title>2017 Partial Solar Eclipse NYC</title>

      <description>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus- there had no clouds on that day- which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.
Today- I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC.</description>

      <description>It was a very nice day today. After waking up- my husband and I decided to go for a hike along the Hudson River. We found Carpenters&amp;rsquo; Trail- which was about 4 miles with a great view of the city.
We started our trip by stopping at this Starbucks. I got a cool lime refresher- which was very refreshing for a hot summer day.
  
 We started the hike from the parking area (TIPS: there was a $5 fee for parking.</description>
