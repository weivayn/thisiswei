      <description>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus- there had no clouds on that day- which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.
Today- I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC.</description>

      <description>It was a very nice day today. After waking up- my husband and I decided to go for a hike along the Hudson River. We found Carpenters&amp;rsquo; Trail- which was about 4 miles with a great view of the city.
We started our trip by stopping at this Starbucks. I got a cool lime refresher- which was very refreshing for a hot summer day.
  
 We started the hike from the parking area (TIPS: there was a $5 fee for parking.</description>
