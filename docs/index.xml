      <description>This year, we started the Christmas celebration by checking off one of the wish-to-try places from our list. I would say overall, I had a SUPER fatty Christmas!
The Atlantic Chipshop was one of the places that I wanted to try for a long time. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe that the original location was closed a few years ago and I have never been there. I heard of this place from a coworker and he said that they deep fry everything here!</description>

      <description>Today was another special day! We have started the week-long celebration a few days before the actual day, so we were able to visit more places!
Mont Blanc 52 was recommended by my husband&amp;rsquo;s best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots.</description>

      <description>It seemed a good idea to visit Nashville in the early December, since we both were into the southern cuisine and country music. We spent the first weekend of December 2017 at this lovely city.
Westin was the hotel that we stayed. This was probably the worst Westin that I have ever been. The room was pretty clean overall. However, a lot of things were missing, like Q-tips and tea/coffee refills.</description>

      <description>Today, I visited my aunt in Flushing Queens. It has been a long time since we hanged out just ourselves.
Alley 41 was our first stop. I was very glad that my aunt took me to this place. I was even more glad that her friends are the chefs here. :) Everything that we ordered was excellent and reminded me of my hometown! We had lettuce root with scrambled eggs (special order, not from the menu), thick noodles 甜水面 (chewy and spicy), Leek w.</description>

      <description>Today was a special day! We decided to celebrate it by visiting a bunch of places in NYC. Even though we did not end up going to Two Little Red Hens, I enjoyed it very much!
SUGARFISH has been a popular sushi spot in the west coast. I was very glad that SUGARFISH opened its NYC location. We came here for celebrating a special day. I ordered the trust me lite, which included organic edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore sushi (1-pc), salmon sushi (1-pc), Nozawa-style shrimp sushi (1-pc) and toro Hand Roll.</description>

      <description>Bagel is one of the iconic food of New York City. They must be chewy, doughy and soft. I suddenly had a huge craving of bagels. My husband and I decided to have a bagel crawl today!
Best Bagel and Coffee located right across from my work. I feel so lucky to be so close to this popular place. I can only visit this place on a rainy day. Otherwise, I will miss my work for sure.</description>

      <description>Cupcakes are normally not my go-to choices for dessert. I still do have my favorite cupcake spots.
Two Little Red Hens has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. This place not only offers great cheesecakes but also awesome cupcakes. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of the cupcake with the mini yellow cupcake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. We got a regular sized one in additional. As they advertised, it was silky smooth and not too sweet.</description>

      <description>There are so many good soup dumpling (Xiaolongbao/小籠包) places in the world. The most well known one must be Din Tai Fung/鼎泰豐. Since Din Tai Fung has not yet entered the New York market, I have tried many other great soup dumplings in the area. And yes, I did have Din Tai Fung.
Shanghai Asian Manor is my favorite place to get soup dumplings. They were much better than Din Tai Fung.</description>

      <description>New Jersey has the most diners in the world and is sometimes referred to as the diner capital of the world. - New Jersey Facts and Trivia from 50states.com.
Here are some diners which I have visited often in the Northern Jersey.
Tops Diner is voted to be the best diner in America, accordingly to Time Out. I feel very lucky to live not too far from here. I did had a bad experience during my first visit.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of Asian influenced cheesecakes that I had so far in my life:
No. 1 Komegash Too is located in Newport Jersey City, which is the only Japanese restaurant in the area. I used to go here quite often. They serve Lady M cheesecake with fresh fruits, cream and mint leaves. The cheesecake is light and fluffy.
 
 No. 2 Ootoya has been one of my favorite lunch spot near Flatiron.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of the cheesecakes, which are served as a dessert item, at a restaurant that I had so far in my life:
Steakhouses No. 1 Peter Luger is the most a New York steakhouse can get. Their porterhouse is definitely out of the world. Cheese cake and Schlag add a great ending to the meal.
 
 No. 2 The Capital Grille in FiDi is my top spot for having the restaurant week lunches.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of the New York Style Cheesecake from a bakery that I had so far in my life:
No. 1 Two Little Red Hens has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. It is located right next to Heidelberg Restaurant. Before visiting this place, my number one choice was Junior&amp;rsquo;s. After had the cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens, I would say this became my favorite cheesecake shop.</description>

      <description>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.
We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at The Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&amp;rsquo;s omelette.</description>

      <description>I am always a big fan of Philippine cuisine, which has similar flavor as Chinese, Spanish and Malaysian cuisines. Dishes ranges from fried fish, whole roasted pig to halo-halo. Since our car maintenance place, Firestone Complete Auto Care, is very close to Journal Square in Jersey City, my husband and I always stop by at least one Filipino restaurant while waiting.
Our usual go-to-spot is Philippine Bread House. There are actually two separate restaurants/shops in the store front.</description>

      <title>2017 Partial Solar Eclipse NYC</title>

      <description>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus, there had no clouds on that day, which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.
Today, I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC.</description>

      <description>It was a very nice day today. After waking up, my husband and I decided to go for a hike along the Hudson River. We found Carpenters&amp;rsquo; Trail, which was about 4 miles with a great view of the city.
We started our trip by stopping at this Starbucks. I got a cool lime refresher, which was very refreshing for a hot summer day.
  
 We started the hike from the parking area (TIPS: there was a $5 fee for parking.</description>
