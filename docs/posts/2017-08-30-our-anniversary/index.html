  <p>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.</p>

<p>We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at <strong><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-butchers-daughter-new-york-2?hrid=UBPjBMn2ACIkC_WQXHB6GA&amp;utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=(direct)" target="_blank">The Butcher&rsquo;s Daughter</a></strong>, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&rsquo;s omelette. The pancakes weren&rsquo;t bad but weren&rsquo;t great either. They were a little bit chewy from the rice flour. However, I wish they went easy on the mixed berries fruits sauce, which was too sweet. The omelette was pretty inspiring, which made with corn,  mushrooms, and avocado. According to the menu, the corn supposed to be crispy, which it wasn&rsquo;t. The service was not up to my standard. It took them a while to bring our dishes, which the table next to us got theirs before us but they sat down after us. The waiter asked every other table on how they felt about the food, except us. Not sure why. Finally, the plants were fake. I would expect more from a vegetarian place.</p>

<p>Right after, we started our tour from Chelsea Piers and went alone the Hudson River all the way up to the north end of Central Park. The whole trip took us about 40 minutes. We took a break at a <strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-new-york-327?hrid=r2oG_WLlJWHg_bcwf8hmnA" target="_blank">Starbucks</a></strong>. We ordered an iced green tea and an iced coffee, which was made pretty quickly. On the way out, one of the staff members was shouting at a customer, and they got the police involved. I expected more from the baristas at Starbucks, who normally was very professional.</p>

<p>It so happened that <strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/cathedral-church-of-st-john-the-divine-new-york-6?hrid=2uKWk1JYhDn8Ot6ev3wLrQ" target="_blank">Cathedral Church of St John the Divine</a></strong> was nearby. We had to stop by and admire the stunning structure.</p>

<p>After riding the bike for another 30 minutes or so, we stopped by <strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/heidelberg-restaurant-new-york?hrid=Q5D6jlZ50C1QjfJtwuNsAA" target="_blank">Heidelberg Restaurant</a></strong>, a very authenticate German place, for lunch. The decor of this place really reminded me of Germany and Switzerland. I was happy that German was eating here too. Since we were here during an odd hour on a Wednesday, this place was very empty. I had the roasted pork lunch, which was served with baked potato and sauerkraut. The pork was very thin and swimming in some gravy. It was tender and tasty. My husband had the sausage platter, which came with three kinds of sausages: bratwurst, bauernwurst, and weisswurst. I liked the bratwurst the most. The Kartoffelpuffer (potato pancakes) were the must have at this place, which was crunchy with the right amount of seasoning. The lunch also came with the bread basket. I would say stay away from the rye, which tasted old. Service was pretty good overall.</p>

<p>We couldn&rsquo;t celebrate the special day without having my favorite dessert - the New York Style cheesecake (check out my review of some of the cheesecake spots <a href="/thisiswei/posts/2017-08-30-cheesecakes">here</a>). <strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-little-red-hens-new-york-4?hrid=vYyFc9rWneRGCZCsmM73cA" target="_blank">Two Little Red Hens</a></strong> has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. It is located right next to Heidelberg Restaurant. Before visiting this place, my number one choice was Junior&rsquo;s. After had the cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens, I would say this became my favorite cheesecake shop. The cheesecake was light and fluffy, which reminded me of Eileen&rsquo;s. It had the sourness as well just like <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/juniors-restaurant-and-cheesecake-new-york?hrid=gMTLJYYdpv4_D7DJpHyh4Q" target="_blank">Junior&rsquo;s</a>. The toasted graham cracker crust was a plus, which had the right amount of sweetness. Moving on to the cupcakes. We had a mini yellow cupcake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. As they advertised, it was silky smooth and not too sweet. We liked it so much and got the regular sized one. We wanted to get a mini cake but the staff told us it was too cold and needed to come to the room temperature before consuming. Too bad but I definitely want to get one eventually.</p>

<p>After having the desserts, we made a stop at the Met Museum to admire some famous paintings and use the bathroom.</p>

<p>Did I mention that we also stopped at the Plaza Hotel for one last time before they were sold? And also the Famous Foot Ware by Penn station.</p>

<p>I have been craving for the brontosaurus rib for a while. Finally, we decided to have it for our anniversary dinner at <strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/mighty-quinns-barbeque-new-york-5?hrid=FGq-INIlYe8SAhAKYA842g" target="_blank">Mighty Quinn&rsquo;s Barbeque</a></strong>. This New York style Barbeque joint has multiple locations. The west village location took reservations, which later I thought it wasn&rsquo;t necessary at all to make. The place was pretty empty at 6:30PM on a Wednesday. We got the brontosaurus rib, adobo baby back ribs, and a sausage. The brontosaurus rib was very oily. After getting rid of the fat, I enjoyed the tender and juicy meat very much. My husband wasn&rsquo;t a big fan though. The adobo baby back ribs were pretty good, which were tender but not super special. The sausage was very good as well.</p>

<p>Oh, my! What a day! There was one more stop that we made before heading home. My husband&rsquo;s coworker highly recommended <strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/roasting-plant-new-york-3?hrid=jlBuobw02i0X9nH9QAkBfw" target="_blank">Roasting Plant</a></strong>, which is located right next to Mighty Quinn&rsquo;s in the west village. We stopped by here after a BBQ feast. This place liked a coffee roasting museum. Baristas were extremely knowledgeable about coffees and suggested a very suitable coffee to my husband. They definitely made the coffee roasting process down to a science. The entire process was controlled by the computer, which programmed to roast the beans and deliver them to the correct brewing station. And then, the beans will be ground and brewed. It was definitely an amazing experience. Did I mention they have milk on tap too?</p>
