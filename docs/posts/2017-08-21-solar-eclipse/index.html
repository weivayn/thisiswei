  <p>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus- there had no clouds on that day- which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.</p>

<p>Today- I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC. People have been talking about it for weeks already. On the very day- I decided to meet up with some of my ex-colleagues for lunch at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yct2k3cy" target="_blank">Friedman&rsquo;s Lunch</a>. While waiting for them- some random guy on the street shouted out load about how cool his sun glasses was and showed off to some girls. To think back- I did wish that I bought a pair when it costed about $7. On the night before- the glasses listed over $500 on Amazon- which was ridiculous! The lunch spot was very popular that all seats were filled about 20 minutes past noon. We were lucky to get a table. I had this place on my wanted to try list for months and finally was able to give it a try. I ordered a grilled salmon salad- which was pretty good except too much onion and Kalamata olives. Salmon was cooked perfectly with a pink center.</p>

<p>After lunch- I went back to the office and noticed other rooms were empty. Our team was probably the only group left on the floor. I decided to join my cousin on the 10th floor- where he setup his heavy equipments for recording this once in a life time event. The sky was very clear until the solar eclipse started. Clouds just came in from no where. We got little upset but at the same time- when a thin patch of clouds passed by- we were able to see the eclipse with our naked eyes. In a way- the clouds helped. The sun looked very far compared to my first solar eclipse experience in China. Plus- we were surrounded by tall buildings in midtown Manhattan- which I felt it wasn&rsquo;t as awesome as I expected. I still had fun.</p>

<p>In the afternoon- my friend contacted me and asked if he can stop by and share some desserts. I can never say no to that. He brought over the cupcake of the day from <a href="http://tinyurl.com/yayfuer" target="_blank">Magnolia Bakery Grand Central Terminal</a> - S&rsquo;more- which was called the &ldquo;eclipse&rdquo; cupcake for suiting today&rsquo;s event. The cupcake was made out of honey graham cake and chocolate filling with meringue icing- which wasn&rsquo;t bad. My friend also got the famous classic banana pudding- which was a little too sweet for me and not enough bananas.</p>

<p>So I decided to take him to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ydedgkel" target="_blank">Little Pie Company</a>- which was about 8 blocks from my work. The banana coconut cream pie definitely tasted much better. I found out about the Little Pie Company through Sobsey&rsquo;s Produce in Hoboken- who sold some of their pies. I have had the sour cream apple walnut pie (the best seller)- the Montmorency cherry pie- Strawberry cheesecake and the key lime pie. The Montmorency cherry pie was definitely my favorite- which was tart but not too sugary. My husband loved the banana coconut cream pie- which was my cat Pumpkin&rsquo;s favorite also! She licked the plate clean. The pie was creamy- smooth and not too sugary- and the sour cream apple walnut pie- which made out of 3 kind of apples. We were both not a big fan of the key lime pie though- which had some metal after taste. I have to go back to the Little Pie Company and try out the remaining flavors.</p>
