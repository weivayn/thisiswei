      <description>Today was a special day! We decided to celebrate it by visiting a bunch of places in NYC.
SUGARFISH has been a popular sushi spot in the west coast. I was very glad that SUGARFISH opened its NYC location. We came here for celebrating a special day. I ordered the trust me lite, which included organic edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore sushi (1-pc), salmon sushi (1-pc), Nozawa-style shrimp sushi (1-pc) and toro Hand Roll.</description>

      <description>Cupcakes are normally not my go-to choices for dessert. I still do have my favorite cupcake spots.
Two Little Red Hens has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. This place not only offers great cheesecakes but also awesome cupcakes. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of the cupcake with the mini yellow cupcake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. We got a regular sized one in additional. As they advertised, it was silky smooth and not too sweet.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of Asian influenced cheesecakes that I had so far in my life:
No. 1 Komegash Too is located in Newport Jersey City, which is the only Japanese restaurant in the area. I used to go here quite often. They serve Lady M cheesecake with fresh fruits, cream and mint leaves. The cheesecake is light and fluffy.
 
 No. 2 Ootoya has been one of my favorite lunch spot near Flatiron.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of the cheesecakes, which are served as a dessert item, at a restaurant that I had so far in my life:
Steakhouses No. 1 Peter Luger is the most a New York steakhouse can get. Their porterhouse is definitely out of the world. Cheese cake and Schlag add a great ending to the meal.
 
 No. 2 The Capital Grille in FiDi is my top spot for having the restaurant week lunches.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of the New York Style Cheesecake from a bakery that I had so far in my life:
No. 1 Two Little Red Hens has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. It is located right next to Heidelberg Restaurant. Before visiting this place, my number one choice was Junior&amp;rsquo;s. After had the cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens, I would say this became my favorite cheesecake shop.</description>

      <description>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.
We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at The Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&amp;rsquo;s omelette.</description>

      <description>I am always a big fan of Philippine cuisine, which has similar flavor as Chinese, Spanish and Malaysian cuisines. Dishes ranges from fried fish, whole roasted pig to halo-halo. Since our car maintenance place, Firestone Complete Auto Care, is very close to Journal Square in Jersey City, my husband and I always stop by at least one Filipino restaurant while waiting.
Our usual go-to-spot is Philippine Bread House. There are actually two separate restaurants/shops in the store front.</description>

      <title>2017 Partial Solar Eclipse NYC</title>
      <link>https://weivayn.github.io/thisiswei/posts/2017-08-21-solar-eclipse/</link>

      <description>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus, there had no clouds on that day, which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.
Today, I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC.</description>
