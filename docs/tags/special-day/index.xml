      <description>Today was another special day! We have started the week-long celebration a few days before the actual day, so we were able to visit more places!
Mont Blanc 52 was recommended by my husband&amp;rsquo;s best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots.</description>

      <description>Today was a special day! We decided to celebrate it by visiting a bunch of places in NYC. Even though we did not end up going to Two Little Red Hens, I enjoyed it very much!
SUGARFISH has been a popular sushi spot in the west coast. I was very glad that SUGARFISH opened its NYC location. We came here for celebrating a special day. I ordered the trust me lite, which included organic edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore sushi (1-pc), salmon sushi (1-pc), Nozawa-style shrimp sushi (1-pc) and toro Hand Roll.</description>

      <description>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.
We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at The Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&amp;rsquo;s omelette.</description>
