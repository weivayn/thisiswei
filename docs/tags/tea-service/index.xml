      <description>Today was a special day! We decided to celebrate it by visiting a bunch of places in NYC. Even though we did not end up going to Two Little Red Hens, I enjoyed it very much!
SUGARFISH has been a popular sushi spot in the west coast. I was very glad that SUGARFISH opened its NYC location. We came here for celebrating a special day. I ordered the trust me lite, which included organic edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore sushi (1-pc), salmon sushi (1-pc), Nozawa-style shrimp sushi (1-pc) and toro Hand Roll.</description>
