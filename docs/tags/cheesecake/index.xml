      <description>Here is my rating of the New York Style Cheesecake that I had so far in my life:
No. 1 Two Little Red Hens has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. It is located right next to Heidelberg Restaurant. Before visiting this place, my number one choice was Junior&amp;rsquo;s. After had the cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens, I would say this became my favorite cheesecake shop.</description>

      <description>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.
We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at The Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&amp;rsquo;s omelette.</description>
