      <description>Today was another special day! We have started the week-long celebration a few days before the actual day, so we were able to visit more places!
Mont Blanc 52 was recommended by my husband&amp;rsquo;s best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of Asian influenced cheesecakes that I had so far in my life:
No. 1 Komegash Too is located in Newport Jersey City, which is the only Japanese restaurant in the area. I used to go here quite often. They serve Lady M cheesecake with fresh fruits, cream and mint leaves. The cheesecake is light and fluffy.
 
 No. 2 Ootoya has been one of my favorite lunch spot near Flatiron.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of the cheesecakes, which are served as a dessert item, at a restaurant that I had so far in my life:
Steakhouses No. 1 Peter Luger is the most a New York steakhouse can get. Their porterhouse is definitely out of the world. Cheese cake and Schlag add a great ending to the meal.
 
 No. 2 The Capital Grille in FiDi is my top spot for having the restaurant week lunches.</description>

      <description>Here is my rating of the New York Style Cheesecake from a bakery that I had so far in my life:
No. 1 Two Little Red Hens has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. It is located right next to Heidelberg Restaurant. Before visiting this place, my number one choice was Junior&amp;rsquo;s. After had the cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens, I would say this became my favorite cheesecake shop.</description>

      <description>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.
We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at The Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&amp;rsquo;s omelette.</description>
