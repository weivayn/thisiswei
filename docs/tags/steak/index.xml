      <description>People normally are going to steakhouses to celebrate a milestone in their life or a special occasion. I am indifferent except I do go to steakhouses from time to time to meet with friends.
Peter Luger is definitely one of my favors. This time, my husband and I decided to take his brother and sister-in-law to Peter Luger for celebrating 2018 and some renovation work that was done by his brother in our place.</description>

      <description>Today was another special day! We have started the week-long celebration a few days before the actual day, so we were able to visit more places!
Mont Blanc 52 was recommended by my husband&amp;rsquo;s best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots.</description>
