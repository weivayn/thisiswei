      <description>Cupcakes are normally not my go-to choices for dessert. I still do have my favorite cupcake spots.
Two Little Red Hens has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. This place not only offers great cheesecakes but also awesome cupcakes. We couldn&amp;rsquo;t have enough of the cupcake with the mini yellow cupcake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. We got a regular sized one in additional. As they advertised, it was silky smooth and not too sweet.</description>

      <description>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus, there had no clouds on that day, which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.
Today, I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC.</description>
