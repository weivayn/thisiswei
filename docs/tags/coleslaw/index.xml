      <description>It seemed a good idea to visit Nashville in the early December, since we both were into the southern cuisine and country music. We spent the first weekend of December 2017 at this lovely city.
Westin was the hotel that we stayed. This was probably the worst Westin that I have ever been. The room was pretty clean overall. However, a lot of things were missing, like Q-tips and tea/coffee refills.</description>
