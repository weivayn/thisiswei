      <description>New Jersey has the most diners in the world and is sometimes referred to as the diner capital of the world. - New Jersey Facts and Trivia from 50states.com.
Here are some diners which I have visited often in the Northern Jersey.
Tops Diner is voted to be the best diner in America, accordingly to Time Out. I feel very lucky to live not too far from here. I did had a bad experience during my first visit.</description>

      <description>I am always a big fan of Philippine cuisine, which has similar flavor as Chinese, Spanish and Malaysian cuisines. Dishes ranges from fried fish, whole roasted pig to halo-halo. Since our car maintenance place, Firestone Complete Auto Care, is very close to Journal Square in Jersey City, my husband and I always stop by at least one Filipino restaurant while waiting.
Our usual go-to-spot is Philippine Bread House. There are actually two separate restaurants/shops in the store front.</description>
