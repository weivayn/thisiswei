      <description>New Jersey has the most diners in the world and is sometimes referred to as the diner capital of the world. - New Jersey Facts and Trivia from 50states.com.
Here are some diners which I have visited often in the Northern Jersey.
Tops Diner is voted to be the best diner in America, accordingly to Time Out. I feel very lucky to live not too far from here. I did had a bad experience during my first visit.</description>
