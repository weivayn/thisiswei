      <description>Today was another special day! We started the celebration a few days before so we were able to explore more place!
Mont Blanc 52 was recommended by my husband&amp;rsquo;s best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots. We also shared the Swiss cheese fondue, which reminded me of the fondue that I had in Zurich.</description>
