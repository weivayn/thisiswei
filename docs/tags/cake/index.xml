      <description>Today was another special day! We have started the week-long celebration a few days before the actual day, so we were able to visit more places!
Mont Blanc 52 was recommended by my husband&amp;rsquo;s best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots.</description>

      <description>I am always a big fan of Philippine cuisine, which has similar flavor as Chinese, Spanish and Malaysian cuisines. Dishes ranges from fried fish, whole roasted pig to halo-halo. Since our car maintenance place, Firestone Complete Auto Care, is very close to Journal Square in Jersey City, my husband and I always stop by at least one Filipino restaurant while waiting.
Our usual go-to-spot is Philippine Bread House. There are actually two separate restaurants/shops in the store front.</description>
