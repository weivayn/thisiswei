      <description>There are so many good soup dumpling (Xiaolongbao/小籠包) places in the world. The most well known one must be Din Tai Fung/鼎泰豐. Since Din Tai Fung has not yet entered the New York market, I have tried many other great soup dumplings in the area. And yes, I did have Din Tai Fung.
Shanghai Asian Manor is my favorite place to get soup dumplings. They were much better than Din Tai Fung.</description>

      <description>It was a very nice day today. After waking up, my husband and I decided to go for a hike along the Hudson River. We found Carpenters&amp;rsquo; Trail, which was about 4 miles with a great view of the city.
We started our trip by stopping at this Starbucks. I got a cool lime refresher, which was very refreshing for a hot summer day.
  
 We started the hike from the parking area (TIPS: there was a $5 fee for parking.</description>
