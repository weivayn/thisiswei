      <description>This year, we started the Christmas celebration by checking off one of the wish-to-try places from our list. I would say overall, I had a SUPER fatty Christmas!
The Atlantic Chipshop was one of the places that I wanted to try for a long time. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe that the original location was closed a few years ago and I have never been there. I heard of this place from a coworker and he said that they deep fry everything here!</description>

      <description>Today, I visited my aunt in Flushing Queens. It has been a long time since we hanged out just ourselves.
Alley 41 was our first stop. I was very glad that my aunt took me to this place. I was even more glad that her friends are the chefs here. :) Everything that we ordered was excellent and reminded me of my hometown! We had lettuce root with scrambled eggs (special order, not from the menu), thick noodles 甜水面 (chewy and spicy), Leek w.</description>

      <description>There are so many good soup dumpling (Xiaolongbao/小籠包) places in the world. The most well known one must be Din Tai Fung/鼎泰豐. Since Din Tai Fung has not yet entered the New York market, I have tried many other great soup dumplings in the area. And yes, I did have Din Tai Fung.
Shanghai Asian Manor is my favorite place to get soup dumplings. They were much better than Din Tai Fung.</description>

      <description>It was a very nice day today. After waking up, my husband and I decided to go for a hike along the Hudson River. We found Carpenters&amp;rsquo; Trail, which was about 4 miles with a great view of the city.
We started our trip by stopping at this Starbucks. I got a cool lime refresher, which was very refreshing for a hot summer day.
  
 We started the hike from the parking area (TIPS: there was a $5 fee for parking.</description>
