      <description>This year, we started the Christmas celebration by checking off one of the wish-to-try places from our list. I would say overall, I had a SUPER fatty Christmas!
The Atlantic Chipshop was one of the places that I wanted to try for a long time. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe that the original location was closed a few years ago and I have never been there. I heard of this place from a coworker and he said that they deep fry everything here!</description>

      <description>There are so many good soup dumpling (Xiaolongbao/小籠包) places in the world. The most well known one must be Din Tai Fung/鼎泰豐. Since Din Tai Fung has not yet entered the New York market, I have tried many other great soup dumplings in the area. And yes, I did have Din Tai Fung.
Shanghai Asian Manor is my favorite place to get soup dumplings. They were much better than Din Tai Fung.</description>
