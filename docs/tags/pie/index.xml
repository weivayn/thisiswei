      <description>Today was another special day! We have started the week-long celebration a few days before the actual day, so we were able to visit more places!
Mont Blanc 52 was recommended by my husband&amp;rsquo;s best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots.</description>

      <description>It seemed a good idea to visit Nashville in the early December, since we both were into the southern cuisine and country music. We spent the first weekend of December 2017 at this lovely city.
Westin was the hotel that we stayed. This was probably the worst Westin that I have ever been. The room was pretty clean overall. However, a lot of things were missing, like Q-tips and tea/coffee refills.</description>

      <title>2017 Partial Solar Eclipse NYC</title>

      <description>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus, there had no clouds on that day, which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.
Today, I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC.</description>
