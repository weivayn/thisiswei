      <description>This year, we started the Christmas celebration by checking off one of the wish-to-try places from our list. I would say overall, I had a SUPER fatty Christmas!
The Atlantic Chipshop was one of the places that I wanted to try for a long time. Can&amp;rsquo;t believe that the original location was closed a few years ago and I have never been there. I heard of this place from a coworker and he said that they deep fry everything here!</description>
