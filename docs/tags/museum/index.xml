      <description>It seemed a good idea to visit Nashville in the early December, since we both were into the southern cuisine and country music. We spent the first weekend of December 2017 at this lovely city.
Westin was the hotel that we stayed. This was probably the worst Westin that I have ever been. The room was pretty clean overall. However, a lot of things were missing, like Q-tips and tea/coffee refills.</description>

      <description>My husband and I like to do things out of ordinary on our anniversaries. Last year, we went to the New Fulton Fish Market, which we had to stay up late for. This year, we decided to do a self-guided bike tour around Manhattan.
We started out from the west village by having the breakfast at The Butcher&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, which both us wanted to try for a while. I ordered matcha green tea pancake and my husband got the butcher&amp;rsquo;s omelette.</description>
