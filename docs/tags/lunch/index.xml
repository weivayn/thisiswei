      <description>Today was a special day! We decided to celebrate it by visiting a bunch of places in NYC. Even though we did not end up going to Two Little Red Hens, I enjoyed it very much!
SUGARFISH has been a popular sushi spot in the west coast. I was very glad that SUGARFISH opened its NYC location. We came here for celebrating a special day. I ordered the trust me lite, which included organic edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore sushi (1-pc), salmon sushi (1-pc), Nozawa-style shrimp sushi (1-pc) and toro Hand Roll.</description>

      <description>It has been years since the last time that I saw a partial solar eclipse in China. I remembered to look out the window of a 6-floor apartment building in an open area was pretty awesome. Plus, there had no clouds on that day, which was very rare in my hometown. The entire process didn&amp;rsquo;t last that long but enough for me to enjoy.
Today, I was able to see the partial solar eclipse again in NYC.</description>
