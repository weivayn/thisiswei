It seemed a good idea to visit Nashville in the early December, since we both were into the southern cuisine and country music. We spent the first weekend of December 2017 at this lovely city.

**[Westin](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-westin-nashville-nashville-2?hrid=tBO0x9mbFr-zCL0nGT0IVQ)** was the hotel that we stayed. This was probably the worst Westin that I have ever been. The room was pretty clean overall. However, a lot of things were missing, like Q-tips and tea/coffee refills. The wall between rooms was very thin. Around 2/3 AM during every night of our stay, we were able to hear someone was partying next door.

**[L27 Rooftop Bar](http://www.yelp.com/biz/l27-rooftop-bar-nashville-2?hrid=wyvYX00dECj2-isscAjeQg)** located on top of the Westin hotel. Since we stayed at the hotel anyway, we thought to stop by here would be a good idea. Turned out, it was just okay. The pool did look very nice though. The security guard was a little mean when we asked him if the pool was open.

**[The Turnip Truck Urban Fare](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-turnip-truck-urban-fare-nashville-3?hrid=YxaJ3l4tKzkzGCHgXBOW4w)** was a great organic/nature shop near the hotel where we stayed. Everything was a little pricey though. It really reminded me of Whole Foods or Trader Joes without the commercial feeling. They had a large selection of kombucha. We even found pink apple, which was actually pink inside.

**[Biscuit Love](http://www.yelp.com/biz/biscuit-love-nashville-7?hrid=FP0m38mXbm664bUD-qWc1A)** was our first stop at Nashville. We came here at 8 AM before this place got super crowded. The ordering process was cafeteria style, which orders were placed before sitting down. The coffee was too sour for my taste. Food was brought out in a reasonable timeframe. We asked for a side of gravy as well. I had the Gertie with everything on the side and I was glad that I did that. Biscuit was fluffy and buttery. My favorite combination was biscuits with peanut butter and chocolate gravy. The caramelized banana jam was too sweet. The pretzel crunch was very good as well. My husband ordered the princess, which came with a biscuit, hot chicken, pickle, mustard, and honey. It tasted very good and definitely gave us a preview of Nashville famous hot chicken!
