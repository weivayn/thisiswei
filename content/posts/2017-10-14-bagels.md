Bagel is one of the iconic food of New York City. They must be chewy, doughy and soft. I suddenly had a huge craving of bagels. My husband and I decided to have a bagel crawl today!

**[Best Bagel and Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/best-bagel-and-coffee-new-york?hrid=3-HU26t6z0HLNBDc7i7lzA)** located right across from my work. I feel so lucky to be so close to this popular place. I can only visit this place on a rainy day. Otherwise, I will miss my work for sure. I ordered a toasted whole wheat bagel with low-fat cream cheese. It was pretty chewy and soft. I was full for hours.

**[Ess-a-Bagel](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ess-a-bagel-new-york?hrid=78aZGep1oFgfboIsTaiExw)** always had a long line, each time when I passed by here. Finally, my husband and I decided to give it a try. Oh man, the wait was totally worth it! We ordered a whole wheat bagel with jalapeño cream cheese, plain bagel with lox cream cheese and a garlic bagel. All bagels were very chewy, including the garlic one which we had the following morning. They did spread a serious amount of cream cheese! So come hungry!

**[Russ and Daughters](https://www.yelp.com/biz/russ-and-daughters-new-york?hrid=fJ3Sdd4JBaMt5wIbeoiOgA)** was always our go-to place for Dutch herrings in New York City. They also offered bagels from Bagel Hole in Brooklyn, which i would like to try once day. The bagel wasn't as good here as the herrings. Maybe because they needed to travel all the way from Park Slope. The lox was very good here!

**[NY Jumbo Bagels](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ny-jumbo-bagels-new-york?hrid=Jr_0Gkt-6k30Qe7458ODxw)** got very high ratings on Yelp. My husband and I decided to give it a try. We had a plain bagel with lox and cream cheese, salmon spread and whitefish spread. Nothing stood out. The total came out about $20, which was super expensive! There was only 2 slices of lox and maybe 1 tablespoon of cream cheese that came with the plain bagel. I would expect little more fillings. The salmon spread was too sweet for my taste and the whitefish spread was too salty.

**[Bagels on the Square](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bagels-on-the-square-new-york?hrid=RQj9RlbOEaWX7rjsTzHVcQ)** was discovered by hubby on the way to work one day. He had gone back here a several mornings. The jalapeño bagel with lox, caper and cream cheese was his favorite! It was mild, chewy and creamy. I got a whole wheat bagel with jalapeño cream cheese which didn't stay out as much. You really had to know what you want to order ahead. Otherwise, you might get "yelled" at by the staff.

**[Wonder Bagels](https://www.yelp.com/biz/wonder-bagels-jersey-city?hrid=DHlmicPuK1ZkW_IHFftvAA)** was definitely one of the best bagel places in Jersey City. There's always a long line on the weekends. And yes, the wonder kitty was always there and super cute. I got a bagel with scallion tofu, which was a mistake! I should have gotten it with the real cream cheese. My husband always wondered what the Taylor ham was exactly. So he decided to get grilled Taylor ham on a cheese bagel. It was okay. I definitely would like to go back and to try the other bagels.
