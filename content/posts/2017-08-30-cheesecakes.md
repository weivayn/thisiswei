Here is my rating of the New York Style Cheesecake that I had so far in my life:

No. 1
------------------
**[Two Little Red Hens](http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-little-red-hens-new-york-4?hrid=vYyFc9rWneRGCZCsmM73cA)** has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. It is located right next to  [Heidelberg Restaurant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/heidelberg-restaurant-new-york?hrid=Q5D6jlZ50C1QjfJtwuNsAA). Before visiting this place, my number one choice was Junior's. After had the cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens, I would say this became my favorite cheesecake shop. The cheesecake was light and fluffy, which reminded me of Eileen's Special Cheesecake. It had the sourness as well just like the Junior's. The toasted graham cracker crust was a plus, which had the right amount of sweetness with a hind of taffy or caramel.

------------------
**[Junior's Restaurant & Cheesecake](https://www.yelp.com/biz/juniors-restaurant-and-cheesecake-new-york?hrid=gMTLJYYdpv4_D7DJpHyh4Q)** is my absolutely all-time favor! I was very lucky to go to school, which was a few blocks away from Junior's original location in Brooklyn. And I was glad that there was another restaurant not too far from my work. My go-to cheesecake has always been the plain, which is tangy, creamy, smooth and rich with the right amount of sweetness. This is also my last meal on earth. I have also tried the strawberry cheesecake, which is as good but on the sweeter side.

**[Eileen's Special Cheesecake](https://www.yelp.com/biz/eileens-special-cheesecake-new-york?hrid=Q5Ffp6p6o7hmxp3fcXhdlA)** is another all-time New Yorkers' favorite. I have been to this place many times and love their fluffy cheesecakes, which are made with egg white, instead of whole eggs. However, I still preferred denser and creamier cheesecakes. It's a great idea that all cheesecakes come in mini sizes, which allowed me to try multiple flavors.

**[Veniero's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/venieros-new-york-2?hrid=hs6S-SRKOewsYvbNpIsUeQ)** is not only a bakery but also a cafe, where I like to enjoy exotic coffee beverages and authentic Italian desserts with friends. The New York style cheesecake is fluffy, creamy and smooth, which I always crave for. It did miss the tanginess though. However, I am not a big fan of the Sicilian cheesecake, which has too many things mixed in. Aside from the cheesecakes, there are many other yummy Italian desserts. The tiramisu and lobster tail are my favorite items to get here.

**[Brownstone Diner & Pancake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/brownstone-diner-and-pancake-factory-jersey-city?hrid=RcR88cM_m-QZTiOi5yScUw)** was featured on the Food Network show - [Diners, Drive-ins and Dives](http://www.foodnetwork.com/restaurants/nj/jersey-city/brownstone-diner-restaurant). And that was how I found out about this place. We used to drive miles away to come here for breakfast and pancakes. One day, we decided to have a slice of their New York style cheesecake with strawberries and I liked it. It tasted like the vanilla ice cream. It was dense and smooth but not tangy at all.

**[The Cheesecake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?hrid=6DSYE-WAskXgJUKvYRSWvg)** at Short Hills Mall is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location. During my visit, there had no wait. The fresh strawberry cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake here, which was creamy and fruity. The Dulce de Leche and chocolate coconut cream were bad. The original cheesecake was bit weird to me, which they put a layer of sour cream on top. It did add sourness but not sure if it blended in with the rest of the cake.

**[The Cheesecake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?hrid=NCheitSe8doESREdEUhUYw)** at Edison NJ, which was the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant that I have ever gone to. The quality of cheesecake was better than other locations. They were pretty fresh. I believed that I have gotten at least 6 kinds of cheesecake here but I was only able to find two pictures. The banana cream cheesecake and Kalua cocoa cheesecake were pretty good.

**[Spot Dessert Bar](https://www.yelp.com/biz/spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3?hrid=ZgsUZp4oSjdWk8L4QCRSKw)** is a dedicated dessert place, which is located on third floor of the Food Gallery in Koreatown. I have been to this place many times with different groups. I would say their desserts were made for people like me, who preferred not-so-sweet desserts. The smoked coconut cheesecake that they offered tasted like an Oreo cheesecake. I wasn't able to taste any coconut in it. The soft cheesecake was close to a yogurt but more creamy.

**[Carlo's Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/carlos-bakery-hoboken?hrid=rM-TmYcytQ69e0VC9754Eg)** is another TV featured bakery. Like Veniero's, they also offer a variety of Italian pastries and cakes. Among all items, I would say the lobster tails are my favorites. Their cheesecakes are not so great, which are too sweet. I tried mini chocolate covered strawberry cheesecake and mini strawberry cheesecake. The cake part was dense, creamy and smooth but no tanginess and too sweet.

**[Dorrian's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/dorrians-jersey-city?hrid=5JtTkBlE4MyH8HifjhFyMg)** in Jersey City is my go-to place for fish and chips and bangers and mash. The manager, Kimmy, is extremely friendly and always remembers me. He even offered us free desserts. The cheesecake over here was just okay comparing it to the other great food that they offered.

**[The Capital Grille](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-capital-grille-new-york-3?hrid=N3JDyDmonCTDwWJ5dmnVTw)** in FiDi is my top spot for having the restaurant week lunches. The cheesecake is creamy with hard caramel top, which is very similar to a creme brulee. It's definitely something out of the ordinary. Sometimes, the cheesecake comes in different shapes too but always serves with some kind of fruit sauce.

**[Ootoya](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ootoya-chelsea-new-york?hrid=LWYNCovy40sREOxKsQij8w)** has been one of my favorite lunch spot near Flatiron. Everything was very authentic. I can always get full and satisfied from here. The Japanese yogurt cheesecake tasted very light and smooth, which was definitely a summery cheesecake.

**[Ben & Jack's Steakhouse](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-and-jacks-steakhouse-new-york-2?hrid=g4arKrG3FBQEKGfQ5wvdoQ)** is known for the history with Peter Luger. The steak was definitely well cooked. The cheesecake was little bit gummy, which I felt was weird.

**[Bobby Van's Steakhouse](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-vans-steakhouse-new-york-3?hrid=TlJ_iRuMrLGtgJ_ZnDwDSw)** is another steakhouse in FiDi. I have also been here at least a few times during the restaurant week. I, of course, got the cheesecake as the dessert. However, it wasn't remarkable and memorable.

**[Tops Diner](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tops-diner-east-newark?hrid=_-OXJBHc-wKhKqhaQUY13w)** is supposed to be the best diner in the area. I really wanted to like it. The food that we ordered tasted good except the original cheesecake, which I had to go. I ate it right when I got home. I had only one bit then I had to throw the entire slice away. It had a very nasty fridge taste, which wasn't fresh at all. I supposed that this was the worst cheesecake that I ever had.

**[The Cheesecake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?hrid=DNBhA8FmEu08ohfaW4yMyQ)** at Jersey City NJ is the most recent Cheesecake Factory location that I have been to. However, the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake, which I took to go, left a bad taste in my mouth. I wasn't able to have more than one bite. It seemed the nuts went bad somehow.
