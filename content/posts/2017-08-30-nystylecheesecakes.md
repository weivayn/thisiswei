Here is my rating of the New York Style Cheesecake from a bakery that I had so far in my life:

No. 1
------------------
**[Two Little Red Hens](http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-little-red-hens-new-york-4?hrid=vYyFc9rWneRGCZCsmM73cA)** has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. It is located right next to  [Heidelberg Restaurant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/heidelberg-restaurant-new-york?hrid=Q5D6jlZ50C1QjfJtwuNsAA). Before visiting this place, my number one choice was Junior's. After had the cheesecake from Two Little Red Hens, I would say this became my favorite cheesecake shop. Both Two Little Red Hens and Junior's came very close. The cheesecake was light and fluffy, which reminded me of Eileen's Special Cheesecake. It also had the sourness just like the Junior's. The toasted graham cracker crust was a plus with the right amount of sweetness and a hind of taffy or caramel.

**[Junior's Restaurant & Cheesecake](https://www.yelp.com/biz/juniors-restaurant-and-cheesecake-new-york?hrid=gMTLJYYdpv4_D7DJpHyh4Q)** is my absolutely all-time favor! I was very lucky to go to school, which was a few blocks away from Junior's original location in Brooklyn. And I was glad that there was another restaurant not too far from my work. My go-to cheesecake has always been the plain, which is tangy, creamy, smooth and rich with the right amount of sweetness. This is also my last meal on earth. I have also tried the strawberry cheesecake, which is as good but on the sweeter side.

**[Eileen's Special Cheesecake](https://www.yelp.com/biz/eileens-special-cheesecake-new-york?hrid=Q5Ffp6p6o7hmxp3fcXhdlA)** is another all-time New Yorkers' favorite. I have been to this place many times and love their fluffy cheesecakes, which are made with egg white, instead of whole eggs. However, I still preferred denser and creamier cheesecakes. It's a great idea that all cheesecakes come in mini sizes, which allowed me to try multiple flavors.

**[Veniero's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/venieros-new-york-2?hrid=hs6S-SRKOewsYvbNpIsUeQ)** is not only a bakery but also a cafe, where I like to enjoy exotic coffee beverages and authentic Italian desserts with friends. The New York style cheesecake is fluffy, creamy and smooth, which I always crave for. It did miss the tanginess though. However, I am not a big fan of the Sicilian cheesecake, which has too many things mixed in. Aside from the cheesecakes, there are many other yummy Italian desserts. The tiramisu and lobster tail are my favorite items to get here.

**[Little Pie Company](https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-pie-company-new-york?hrid=91nxydr_BvAFLeLUr8jPFw)** is my favorite pie place in the city. It offers mini sweet and savory pies. Yes, the cheesecake is considered a pie. Strawberry cheesecake is creamy and pretty good, which reminds me of the vanilla ice cream. I would prefer the cheesecake had a little more sourness in it.

**[The Cheesecake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-short-hills?hrid=6DSYE-WAskXgJUKvYRSWvg)** at Short Hills Mall is my favorite Cheesecake Factory location. During my visit, there had no wait. The fresh strawberry cheesecake is my favorite cheesecake here, which was creamy and fruity. The Dulce de Leche and chocolate coconut cream were bad. The original cheesecake was bit weird to me, which they put a layer of sour cream on top. It did add sourness but not sure if it blended in with the rest of the cake.

**[The Cheesecake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-edison?hrid=NCheitSe8doESREdEUhUYw)** at Edison NJ, which was the first Cheesecake Factory restaurant that I have ever gone to. The quality of cheesecake was better than other locations. They were pretty fresh. I believed that I have gotten at least 6 kinds of cheesecake here but I was only able to find two pictures. The banana cream cheesecake and Kalua cocoa cheesecake were pretty good.

**[Billy's Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/billys-bakery-new-york?hrid=bipdqyvVp8q5Ed-V_3i6Sg)** is another great bakery in New York. The cakes are generally on the sweet side, except the cherry cheesecake. It is creamy but not too sweet. The cherries on the top are big plus.

**[Carlo's Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/carlos-bakery-hoboken?hrid=rM-TmYcytQ69e0VC9754Eg)** is another TV featured bakery. Like Veniero's, they also offer a variety of Italian pastries and cakes. Among all items, I would say the lobster tails are my favorites. Their cheesecakes are not so great, which are too sweet. I tried mini chocolate covered strawberry cheesecake and mini strawberry cheesecake. The cake part was dense, creamy and smooth but no tanginess and too sweet.

**[The Cheesecake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-cheesecake-factory-jersey-city?hrid=DNBhA8FmEu08ohfaW4yMyQ)** at Jersey City NJ is the most recent Cheesecake Factory location that I have been to. However, the caramel macadamia nut cheesecake, which I took to go, left a bad taste in my mouth. I wasn't able to have more than one bite. It seemed the nuts went bad somehow.
