[UPDATED on 01/04/2018] I managed to make back to visit [Sugar Sweet Sunshine Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-sweet-sunshine-bakery-new-york?hrid=DmOb6parkt1BwwbPHj8-4g) and have a coconut cupcake.

[POSTED on 10/09/2017] Cupcakes are normally not my go-to choices for dessert. I still do have my favorite cupcake spots.

**[Two Little Red Hens](http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-little-red-hens-new-york-4?hrid=vYyFc9rWneRGCZCsmM73cA)** has been listed as the No. 1 dessert spot in NYC. This place not only offers great cheesecakes but also awesome cupcakes. We couldn't have enough of the cupcake with the mini yellow cupcake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. We got a regular sized one in additional. As they advertised, it was silky smooth and not too sweet.

**[Buttercup Bake Shop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/buttercup-bake-shop-new-york-8?hrid=t_yqmlpg3QDWlYDibW3cUQ)** was rated one of the top cupcake spots in midtown east area. The cupcakes weren't bad here. Normally, the vanilla cupcakes tend to be sweeter than the chocolate ones. So I decided to get S'mores, which was a dark choc cake torched meringue, topped with toasted marshmallow, and the graham cracker crust. It had the right amount of sweetness. My husband got the salted caramel, which was Dulce de Leche cake with Swirls of salted caramel buttercream (sea salt). It was very sweet. And he was regretting of getting it. We got a free mini VanVan, which was a vanilla cake with vanilla buttercream, with the Yelp check-in. The cashier wanted to give us another one, which was very nice of her.

**[Molly's Cupcakes](https://www.yelp.com/biz/mollys-cupcakes-new-york?hrid=2_TJzQTR36lls3BngyXfVA)** is another my all time favorite cupcake spot. It was originated from Chicago. All cupcakes were stuffed! They were so moist and not too sweet. Salted caramel butterscotch seemed to be one of their best sellers. I was hoping for more cheesecake flavor in the blueberry cheesecake cupcake. The mini vanilla cupcake with vanilla frosting was very moist but too sweet.

**[Swirlz Cupcakes](https://www.yelp.com/biz/swirlz-cupcakes-chicago?hrid=JpZxcYR0fvuMvT2v6cyMXw)** is another awesome Chicago cupcake shop. We visited this place during the Chicago bike tour. They offered a variety of cupcake flavors, including gluten-free and vegan options. They used buttercream for all frostings. I had a Strawberry Strawberry and Alex had a Vanilla cupcake. This place was tiny but you can certainly enjoy the cupcakes outside.

**[Sugar Sweet Sunshine Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sugar-sweet-sunshine-bakery-new-york?hrid=DmOb6parkt1BwwbPHj8-4g)** has very high ratings on Yelp. I have gone to this place about 5 years ago. I have had strawberry cake with cream cheese, which was very yummy with strawberries in every single bite. And also the pistachio cupcake was not sweet at all!! It was very moist and you can really taste the butter in the "moose".

[UPDATED on 01/04/2018] The coconut cupcake was good but the buttercream was little too sweet.

**[Sophie Sophia](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sophie-sophia-jersey-city-2?hrid=2-NaSX_jrERNGF2vTs2EWA)** was located in Hamilton Square, Jersey City. Too bad it was closed. I used to love this little tiny place. My husband and I used to go there on Saturdays after going to the gym. However, they started "by appointment only".

**[Baked by Melissa](https://www.yelp.com/biz/baked-by-melissa-new-york-12?hrid=Qc8A_5EouGbhK47aSJ1prA)** is a chain store, which offers tiny cupcakes. They were so small but dangerous. I could eat so many of them. However, they tend to be too sweet though.

**[Carlo's Bakery](https://www.yelp.com/biz/carlos-bakery-hoboken?hrid=rM-TmYcytQ69e0VC9754Eg)** is totally overrated. If it's not for the TV show, they won't have a long line in front of their shop. In general, the desserts were too sweet for my taste.

**[The Sweet Spot Shoppe](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-sweet-spot-bake-shoppe-chester?hrid=4vRi1DEeHJ--kTLkFo4ZwQ)** is located in Chester, NJ. We discovered this place after a hiking trip. I definitely had better cupcakes. Can't believe this place got such high ratings with overly sweetened cupcakes. The mini vanilla cupcake with vanilla buttercream was not eatable. Normally, that's my husband's favorite cupcake but he only took one small bite. :( What a shame!

**[Baking Mama](https://www.yelp.com/biz/baking-mama-hoboken?hrid=qIDKjf79lXKIMliu4hVyoQ)** is a local bake shop by the Hudson River. I have Baking Mama bookmarked for a long time and always wanted to try it. My husband wanted to try their vanilla cupcake, which was such a mistake. The cake part was pretty dry and hard. The frosting was crunchy outside and too sweet. It was definitely not fresh.
