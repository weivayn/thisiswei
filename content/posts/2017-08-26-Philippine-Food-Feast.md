I am always a big fan of Philippine cuisine, which has similar flavor as Chinese, Spanish and Malaysian cuisines. Dishes ranges from fried fish, [whole roasted pig](https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cafe-pilipino-jersey-city?select=Tkdi-PFOcZTPtK-dFu5RZw&reviewid=BUZJ8Dcay1X9hqs6klxMjw) to halo-halo. Since our car maintenance place, [Firestone Complete Auto Care](https://www.yelp.com/biz/firestone-complete-auto-care-jersey-city-3?hrid=YXY-aEj4IHUitfemtH-DGg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)), is very close to Journal Square in Jersey City, my husband and I always stop by at least one Filipino restaurant while waiting.

Our usual go-to-spot is [Philippine Bread House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/philippine-bread-house-jersey-city?hrid=64qitYJvjCxrX0SzXjHNMg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)). There are actually two separate restaurants/shops in the store front. By the main entrance, it's Philippine Break House, which is the actual bakery. In the back, it's [Cafe Pilipino](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-pilipino-jersey-city?hrid=BUZJ8Dcay1X9hqs6klxMjw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct)), where they serve food.

During our most recent trip, we went to **[Little Quiapo](https://www.yelp.com/biz/little-quiapo-jersey-city?hrid=vGCSLBpCje4wC46vL0IFcA&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))** for the first time. We almost missed this tiny 4-table place, which is located in a parking lot next to Philippine Bread House. I ordered the pork chop dinner, which seemed the most popular item on the menu. The Filipino version of pork chops was actually deep fried seasoned pork belly. The dish also came with 1 cup of garlic rice, two fried eggs, and a side of atchara. Atchara is a pickle made from grated unripe papaya. The dish was about $8 and was definitely a must have. My husband had the big breakfast ($9), which came with two meat items, 2 fried eggs, 2 cups of garlic rice and a side of atchara. He picked adobo chicken and beef stew as the two meat items, which both tasted great.

Compare to Little Quiapo, **[Cafe Pilipino](https://www.yelp.com/biz/cafe-pilipino-jersey-city?hrid=BUZJ8Dcay1X9hqs6klxMjw&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))** had a lot more variety options. Around $10, you can get two meals. Similar to the cafeteria style, if you see something looks good, you order it. The adobo style meats were the best. I have added the pork, beef, and chicken. They were tender, tangy and salty.

After the lunch, we always got desserts. This time we went for **[Red Ribbon Bakeshop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/red-ribbon-bakeshop-jersey-city?hrid=Ch8zn8AIIV3x5BmSlEvhwQ&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))** to change up a bit. Red Ribbon Bakeshop is located right across from Jersey City Public Library. The area seemed not very safe, which there was a bullet hole in the window of this store. Bread and dessert displays were arranged right at the entrance, which a lot of people were cluttering. We decided to give the ube overload cake a try since we liked the ube cake from  Philippine Bread House a lot. Turned out, it exceeded our expectations. At first, we thought a very commercial place like this will not pay attention to the quality. However, we were wrong. The cake was very fluffy and light. To be honest, I liked it more than the ube cake at Philippine Bread House.

Last but not least, I still really like **[Philippine Bread House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/philippine-bread-house-jersey-city?hrid=64qitYJvjCxrX0SzXjHNMg&utm_campaign=www_review_share_popup&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=(direct))**. It seemed that they have changed the receipt for the ube creme roll. I remembered it used to be having the just right amount of sweetness. Now, the creme part of the roll was so sweet! I had to scrap it off. The cake part was still not too bad. I have also got an ube stuffed sesame ball, egg custard, and garlic peanuts. Among all the items, I liked the ube stuffed sesame ball the most, which was not too sweet and chewy. The egg custard was too dense for me. I preferred the Chinese ones better. The garlic peanuts were too burned to hubby. I liked it, which was crunchy and garlicky. The freshly baked diner rolls were to die for. For less than $2, you can get about 8 rolls.
