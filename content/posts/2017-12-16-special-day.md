Today was another special day! We started the celebration a few days before so we were able to explore more place!

**[Mont Blanc 52](http://www.yelp.com/biz/mont-blanc-52-new-york-2?hrid=Ma13QeAY25yVBFuO2yoXUQ)**  was recommended by my husband's best friend. WARNING: melting cheese smells funky. We started with some house salad with light dressing. We shared lightly fried calamari and escargots. The garlic butter where escargots swam in was remarkable! I dipped bread in it after finishing escargots. We also shared the Swiss cheese fondue, which reminded me of the fondue that I had in Zurich. I was feeling buzzed after eating it. :) Emince de Veau à la Zurichoise, which was the traditional swiss minced veal, cream, mushroom & onions. It tasted very good as well. The service was pretty good here, except the place was super tight to move around.

**[Patisserie Chanson](https://www.yelp.com/biz/patisserie-chanson-new-york?hrid=_sRZ7nRro4SGaRibcF8_vw)** is a perfect place to have French pastries and desserts. We came here for the afternoon tea. It came with 3 layers of goodies. The bottom layer had the scone, mushroom toast and salmon toast. The middle layer had lemon poppy seed cake, orange chocolate cake, and chocolate eclair. The top layer had jasmine macaron, caramel chocolate, and caramel bonbon. Everything was so good, especially the scone! You can also receive unlimited refills for scones.

**[Two Little Red Hens](http://www.yelp.com/biz/two-little-red-hens-new-york-4?hrid=6wl4cxDAscNNmK3gwK9qSA)** has never disappointed me. It was my husband's birthday and I got him his favorite yellow cake with Swiss vanilla buttercream. I tried to ask for no sprinkles but it seemed not possible. It was a good idea to let the cake sit at the room temperature for a while and let the buttercream soften. I have also gotten a slice of cheesecake and cherry pie. The cheesecake was indeed again the best in NYC! The cherry pie was very good and I was able to tell that they made the sauce in-house. About two days prior, we went there with one of my coworkers. We got a mini chocolate cupcake, a regular yellow cupcake, and a carrot cupcake. Normally, I don't like carrot cakes but this one was very good! I loved that there had walnut inside and the spices weren't super overwhelmed.
