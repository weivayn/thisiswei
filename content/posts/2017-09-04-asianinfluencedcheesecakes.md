Here is my rating of Asian influenced cheesecakes that I had so far in my life:

No. 1
------------------
**[Komegash Too](https://www.yelp.com/biz/komegashi-too-jersey-city?hrid=MzS796qKW6ZCAay6GMIM0g)** is located in Newport Jersey City, which is the only Japanese restaurant in the area. I used to go here quite often. They serve Lady M cheesecake with fresh fruits, cream and mint leaves. The cheesecake is light and fluffy.

No. 2
------------------
**[Ootoya](https://www.yelp.com/biz/ootoya-chelsea-new-york?hrid=LWYNCovy40sREOxKsQij8w)** has been one of my favorite lunch spot near Flatiron. Everything was very authentic. I can always get full and satisfied from here. The Japanese yogurt cheesecake tasted very light and smooth, which was definitely a summery cheesecake.

No. 3
------------------
**[Spot Dessert Bar](https://www.yelp.com/biz/spot-dessert-bar-new-york-3?hrid=ZgsUZp4oSjdWk8L4QCRSKw)** is a dedicated dessert place, which is located on third floor of the Food Gallery in Koreatown. I have been to this place many times with different groups. I would say their desserts were made for people like me, who preferred not-so-sweet desserts. The smoked coconut cheesecake that they offered tasted like an Oreo cheesecake. I wasn't able to taste any coconut in it. The soft cheesecake was close to a yogurt but more creamy.
