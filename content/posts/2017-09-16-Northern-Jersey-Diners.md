New Jersey has the most diners in the world and is sometimes referred to as the diner capital of the world. - *New Jersey Facts and Trivia from [50states.com](http://www.50states.com/facts/new-jersey.htm)*.

Here are some diners which I have visited often in the Northern Jersey.


**[Tops Diner](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tops-diner-east-newark?hrid=IKGbyY37bnpYLwMdPizp5g)** is voted to be the best diner in America, accordingly to [Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/usa/restaurants/best-diners-in-america). I feel very lucky to live not too far from here. I did had a bad experience during my first visit. The manager actually commented [my Yelp review](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tops-diner-east-newark?hrid=_-OXJBHc-wKhKqhaQUY13w), which I appreciated a lot. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. This time I had a better experience than my last visit. Upon arriving, there were a few groups waiting outside and inside of the diner. I gave the host my number and received a text when my table was ready, which was a huge plus for a popular place. We were seated after waiting for 15 minutes, which was pretty consistent with the estimation from the host. The waiter was very friendly, which I didn't feel be rushed at all. I got the quinoa tower from Saturday brunch menu, 2 scratch pancakes with warm syrup & whipped butter, and a cup of coffee. My husband got the Texas chili, pot roast and a cup of coffee. My favorite item among all was the pancakes. They were light and fluffy with a slide yellow color, which I thought it must be from eggs. I would say they were probably one of the best pancakes that I had at a diner. Some diners like to put too much baking soda to make the pancakes fluffy, such as the Brownstone Diner. I wish the waiter asked or checked if we wanted more water or coffee. My cup and glass were pretty dry.
