New Jersey has the most diners in the world and is sometimes referred to as the diner capital of the world. - *New Jersey Facts and Trivia from [50states.com](http://www.50states.com/facts/new-jersey.htm)*.

Here are some diners which I have visited often in the Northern Jersey.


**[Tops Diner](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tops-diner-east-newark?hrid=IKGbyY37bnpYLwMdPizp5g)** is voted to be the best diner in America, accordingly to [Time Out](https://www.timeout.com/usa/restaurants/best-diners-in-america). I feel very lucky to live not too far from here. I did had a bad experience during my first visit. The manager actually commented [my Yelp review](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tops-diner-east-newark?hrid=_-OXJBHc-wKhKqhaQUY13w), which I appreciated a lot. Therefore, I decided to give it another try. This time I had a better experience than my last visit. Upon arriving, there were a few groups waiting outside and inside of the diner. I gave the host my number and received a text when my table was ready, which was a huge plus for a popular place. We were seated after waiting for 15 minutes, which was pretty consistent with the estimation from the host. The waiter was very friendly, which I didn't feel be rushed at all. I got the quinoa tower from Saturday brunch menu, 2 scratch pancakes with warm syrup & whipped butter, and a cup of coffee. My husband got the Texas chili, pot roast and a cup of coffee. My favorite item among all was the pancakes. They were light and fluffy with a slide yellow color, which I thought it must be from eggs. I would say they were probably one of the best pancakes that I had at a diner. Some diners like to put too much baking soda to make the pancakes fluffy, such as the Brownstone Diner. I wish the waiter asked or checked if we wanted more water or coffee. My cup and glass were pretty dry.

**[Schnackenbergâ€™s Luncheonette](https://www.yelp.com/biz/schnackenbergs-luncheonette-hoboken-3?hrid=LH0Ktglshkc72ybpBDBXfA)** is a small place in Hoboken, which offers awesome donuts and chocolates! Unlike the normal diner style restaurants, upon entering this place I noticed the chocolate display on the left side. I have tried the roasted vegetables wrap with home made chips, the tuna melt with home made chips, Dulce de Leche donut, and Boston creme donut. Everything turned out very good especially the chips and donuts. Chips were crispy and light. Donuts weren't too sweet and moist. I would definitely go back for more.

**[Brownstone Diner & Pancake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/brownstone-diner-and-pancake-factory-jersey-city?hrid=RcR88cM_m-QZTiOi5yScUw)** was featured on the Food Network show - [Diners, Drive-ins and Dives](http://www.foodnetwork.com/restaurants/nj/jersey-city/brownstone-diner-restaurant). And that was how I found out about this place. We used to drive miles away to come here for having breakfast and pancakes. It's very sad that I have keep lowering my Yelp ratings from 3 to 2. To summarize, the service is HORRIBLE, especially during the prim time. The food quality is also going downhill. For example, the famous pancakes used to be very fluffy and tasty. Now, the pancakes are still fluffy with a lot of baking soda. I was able to taste it. On the other hand, the cheesecake tastes very good for a diner.
