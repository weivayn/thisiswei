Today was a special day! We decided to celebrate it by visiting a bunch of places in NYC.

**[SUGARFISH](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sugarfish-by-sushi-nozawa-new-york?hrid=mbQTLQD8fwZlpO8yvIxm1g)** has been a popular sushi spot in the west coast. I was very glad that SUGARFISH opened its NYC location. We came here for celebrating a special day. I ordered the trust me lite, which included organic edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore sushi (1-pc), salmon sushi (1-pc), Nozawa-style shrimp sushi (1-pc) and toro Hand Roll. The amount was just right. I wanted to save the space for dessert. My husband ordered the Nozawa trust me, which came with organic edamame, tuna sashimi, albacore sushi (2-pc), salmon sushi (2-pc), yellowtail sushi (2-pc), snapper* sushi (1-pc), sea bass sushi (1-pc), toro hand roll, blue crab hand roll and sweet shrimp sushi (2-pc). He also ordered a side of toro. Everything was super fresh and tasty. No wonder the wait was long at all its locations.

**[Patisserie Chanson](https://www.yelp.com/biz/patisserie-chanson-new-york?hrid=_sRZ7nRro4SGaRibcF8_vw)** is a perfect place to have French pastries and desserts. We came here for the afternoon tea. It came with 3 layers of goodies. The bottom layer had the scone, mushroom toast and salmon toast. The middle layer had lemon poppy seed cake, orange chocolate cake, and chocolate eclair. The top layer had jasmine macaron, caramel chocolate, and caramel bonbon. Everything was so good, especially the scone! You can also receive unlimited refills for scones.
