This year, we started the Christmas celebration by checking off one of the wish-to-try places from our list. I would say overall, I had a SUPER fatty Christmas!

**[The Atlantic Chipshop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-atlantic-chipshop-brooklyn?hrid=L9g1wfXBodDiAC7yXu-UXQ)** was one of the places that I wanted to try for a long time. Can't believe that the original location was closed a few years ago and I have never been there. I heard of this place from a coworker and he said that they deep fry everything here! Finally, I was able to give it a try. The decor of this place really reminded me of an old English pub. There were a lot of English posters hanging on the walls. The tables were decorated with English stamps and coins. I got the full English breakfast. It came with a lot of things. My favorite items were the tomato, which was tender and juicy, and the toast, which was thick and crispy. My husband got the bangers and mash, which tasted very good. Finally, we got to try the most famous fried Twinkie, which I have been wanting to for the longest time! It served with homemade berry sauce, which was a plus. I would definitely like to go back and try the other deep fried items, such as the fish & chips and deep fried candy bars.

**[Shelsky's Smoked Fish](https://www.yelp.com/biz/shelskys-smoked-fish-brooklyn-3?hrid=lPwFucVPCB94UqEU-H0Ttg)** is one of the places that can be easily missed. Not sure how long this place has been around. I used to go to school nearby but have never noticed it! There was a lot of things that you can order. We got some smoked salmon, peppered salmon, smoked whitefish and French herrings from here. Everything tasted very fresh and mild except the French herring. The service was a little slow. We waited for a long time to get our fish.

**[Vogue CafÃ©](https://www.yelp.com/biz/vogue-caf%C3%A9-jersey-city-2?hrid=XdjfXdYVjddDJWLM_Xkatw)** was open on the day after Christmas. We stopped by this cafe because our original destination was closed. Turned out this place was good! I liked how they have savory croissants, which I have never seen before. My husband got the boeuf bourguignon croissant, which was flaky and salty. I had the leek and bacon quiche, which was tasty but a little bit different than the quiche I normally had. I think it had less cheese and bacon was not evenly distributed. This place was definitely interesting. We saw a chef was making a dough in the kitchen without wearing gloves and holding a cellphone up to her ear. It didn't look appealing at all.

**[Toby's Estate Coffee](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tobys-estate-coffee-new-york?hrid=16ioQTe3Zb6gG_QItG6ofw)** was on my way to meet up with my husband at his work. Finally, we decided to give it a try. We both ordered a cappuccino. He had the one with regular milk, while I was having it with almond milk. Both tasted very creamy and good. I liked how we were able to enjoy the drinks in the store behind the cafe. We sat on the bench and flipped though some books, while we were there.

**[Tim Ho Wan](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tim-ho-wan-new-york-2?hrid=W0-KLNy0UEDIGnPgSBRnaQ)**  has been a long time since I wanted to try this place! After waiting for 40 minutes or so, we were finally seated. We were super hungry so end up ordering too much food. Between two of us, we ordered steamed shrimp dumplings (good quality ad the best I ever had), steamed pork dumplings with shrimp (very yummy), steamed beef ball with bean curd skin (unlike the other ones I had before, it didn't have too much dried orange skins), pan-fried turnip cake (yum), baked bun with BBQ pork (the best ever!), deep-fried dumplings filled with pork and shrimp (chewy and yummy), congee with pork and preserved eggs (two kinds of eggs, yum), and green tea sesame balls with red bean (chewy and not too sweet). Overall, I liked this place and I would like to visit the Hong Kong locations during my upcoming trip in 2018. Can't wait!
