Today, I visited my aunt in Flushing Queens. It has been a long time since we hanged out just ourselves.

**[Alley 41](http://www.yelp.com/biz/alley-41-flushing-2?hrid=8c2SvZeGwpmyEv9K-dRueg)** was our first stop. I was very glad that my aunt took me to this place. I was even more glad that her friends are the chefs here. :) Everything that we ordered was excellent and reminded me of my hometown! We had lettuce root with scrambled eggs (special order, not from the menu), thick noodles 甜水面 (chewy and spicy), Leek w. Pork Dumpling 韭菜豬肉水餃 (thin skin), Boiled Sliced Fish in Hot Chili Sauce 蜀巷沸騰魚 (spicy and tasty), Brown sugar pancake 红糖饼 (yum! love the running melted brown sugar filling), and Frog w. Dry Pepper 乾鍋香辣田雞. I would definitely like to go back there again.

**[C Fruit Life](http://www.yelp.com/biz/c-fruit-life-flushing-2?hrid=p1-j72SDm9NTvdgr1Dm5hw)** used to be my aunt's go-to place for desserts. We ordered the fruit tea without sugar and half black sesame puree & half walnut puree 芝麻糊捞核桃糊. Both items were great. I liked how the staff kept refilling our tea. We were able to sit here for at least one hour without being kicked out. I would definitely want to try the durian desserts next time.
