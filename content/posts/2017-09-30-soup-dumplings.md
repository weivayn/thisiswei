There are so many good soup dumpling (Xiaolongbao/小籠包) places in the world. The most well known one must be [Din Tai Fung/鼎泰豐](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Din_Tai_Fung). Since Din Tai Fung has not yet entered the New York market, I have tried many other great soup dumplings in the area. And yes, I did have Din Tai Fung.

**[Shanghai Asian Manor](https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-asian-manor-new-york?hrid=clQEfSJc_rGZBGP-EzBtYw)** is my favorite place to get soup dumplings. They were much better than Din Tai Fung. Steamed tiny buns with pork were better than the steamed tiny buns with crab meat and pork. They were juicy and tasty with very thin skins. Black truffle pork dumplings weren't worth the money, which were on the dryer side. I introduced this place to a friend. She loved it so much and ordered from here weekly for dinner.

**[Nanxiang](http://www.yelp.com/biz/nan-xiang-xiao-long-bao-flushing?hrid=4O_rtNer933cX5D94HkiFg)** is very far away from where I live. I have heard about this place for a while before I got a chance to give it a try. There was a little wait when we arrived. The line moved pretty quick though. The steamed pork buns or xiao long bao was definitely good with thin skins, tasty soup, and well-seasoned meat.

**[Din Tai Fung](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g297463-d4698423-r528714986-Din_Tai_Fung-Chengdu_Sichuan.html#SHOW_USER_REVIEW)** was located in Chengdu. This was probably the only Din Tai Fung on the earth didn't have a long wait in December 2016. And this location was closed during my most recent visit in March 2017. I believed that's because people loved spicy food in Chengdu and Din Tai Fung only offered much milder dishes. There was a large selection of different kinds of soup dumplings. My favorite was the crab and pork one. However, the size of the dumplings was pretty small. I felt the ones in NYC were a lot better.

**[456 Shanghai Restaurant](http://www.yelp.com/biz/456-shanghai-cuisine-new-york?hrid=g_QuND_Uyj1DAfjkYZbo8A)** is another Shanghainese place in Chinatown. I visited here a long time ago. I remembered that the dumplings had pretty thin skin and tasty soup.

**[Soup Dumpling Plus](https://goo.gl/v4wv1T)** located in Fort Lee. A friend of ours had mentioned quite a few times about having brunch here. I had much better steamed pork soup dumplings in Chinatown. These had thicker skins, less meat and lack of flavor.

**[Taste of North China](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taste-of-north-china-jersey-city?hrid=iAELrLeWoKr3cUT-0euv_A)** locates in the downtown Jersey City near the Exchange Place PATH stop. A Yelper recommended this place to me during a Yelp Elite event. The steamed pork soup dumpling (灌湯小籠包) were probably my less favorite dish here. The skin of the dumplings was too thick and the soup tasted a little bloody. They did offer other dishes which were worth a trip to visit.

**[Shanghai Best](https://www.yelp.com/biz/shanghai-best-jersey-city?hrid=_d6YrHFLwmjnAXzFT5EF6A)** is another Chinese restaurant in Jersey City, which I normally ordered delivery from this place. Just like the other Jersey soup dumplings, their pork soup dumplings had thick skin.
