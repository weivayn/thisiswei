There are so many good soup dumpling (Xiaolongbao/小籠包) places in the world. The most well known one must be [Din Tai Fung (鼎泰豐)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Din_Tai_Fung). Since Din Tai Fung has not yet entered the New York market, I have tried many other great soup dumplings in the area. And yes, I did have Din Tai Fung.

**[Taste of North China](http://www.yelp.com/biz/taste-of-north-china-jersey-city?hrid=iAELrLeWoKr3cUT-0euv_A)** locates in the downtown Jersey City near the Exchange Place PATH stop. A Yelper recommended this place to me during a Yelp Elite event. The steamed pork soup dumpling (灌湯小籠包) were probably my less favorite dish here. The skin of the dumplings was too thick and the soup tasted a little bloody. They did offer other dishes which were worth a trip to visit.
