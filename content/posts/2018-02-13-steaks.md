People normally are going to steakhouses to celebrate a milestone in their life or a special occasion. I am indifferent except I do go to steakhouses from time to time to meet with friends.

**[Peter Luger](https://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?hrid=k2FntEWZpoH5q5G-dqHmBg)** is definitely one of my favors. This time, my husband and I decided to take his brother and sister-in-law to Peter Luger for celebrating 2018 and some renovation work that was done by his brother in our place. It was his brother and sister-in-law's first visit at Peter Luger. We decided to go with the full experience by ordering the dry aged steak for four, thick cut bacon, creamy spinach and Schlag. My sister-in-law was doing paleo so she asked for the fresh broccoli. I also ordered the cheese cake. The medium rare steak was well cooked. It was tender and had the dry aged flavor. We were very happy with how it turned out. The thick cut bacon was pretty good but I think Del Frisco did their bacon better and thicker. Creamy spinach was tender and creamy. Fresh broccoli was crunchy and well cooked. The cheese cake was definitely one of the best that I had in restaurants. It could be at the same level as Junior's cheesecake, which was creamy and not too sweet. The only difference between Peter Luger's and Juniors was the sourness. Juniors cheesecake definitely had the hint of lemon. Schlag was just the must-have here. The cream was well whipped, light and fluffy with the right amount of sweetness.

**[Del Frisco’s Double Eagle Steak House](https://www.yelp.com/biz/del-friscos-double-eagle-steak-house-new-york-2?hrid=Efl2CRrqcQe44bq1AuetMQ)** becomes one of my favorite steakhouses. I took my husband here for his birthday. We had Del's jumbo lump crab cake (made with real crab & very fresh), Thick-cut Nueske's bacon Au Poivre with bourbon molasses glaze (the best bacon I have ever had), 45 days dry aged double cut prime ribeye (the best steak in my opinion), and complimentary desserts (chocolate soufflé cake, vanilla ice cream and butter cake). Everything was so good, especially the bacon, steak, and butter cake! We were so stuffed. The service was excellent! I would definitely go back to celebrate another special day!

**[Walter's Steakhouse](https://www.yelp.com/biz/walters-steakhouse-wilmington?hrid=E6pYUYHLXLxf8mZuBv41XQ)** is definitely worth a trip to travel to. The prime rib was out of the world! I have tried to look for other prime rib places in NYC but nothing can compete with Walter's. They were tender, juicy and flavorful. On certain days of the week, the seafood and salad bar were offered, which was a very good deal. I have also tried the salmon and crab imperial. They were perfectly cooked. The baked potato came with a lot of toppings, such as bacon, sour cream... Even better, they were offered in separate dishes and you can add them as desired.

**[Prime & Beyond](https://www.yelp.com/biz/prime-and-beyond-fort-lee?hrid=XI52J1yo_IZQ1DpkFmQGNg)** is a Korean steakhouse, which serves not only steaks but Korean side dishes like kimchi fried rice. There were a lot of people at the restaurant during the lunchtime. We ordered a lot of things from the dinner menu. We started with the green salad with sesame dressing. The dressing was amazing but not overwhelming the salad. Then we had the tornado fries, which was a deep fried spiral-cut whole potato on a skewer. It was very fun to eat. The sausage plate came with two pieces of chicken sausage, a veal sausage, and a pork sausage. I think the pork tasted the best among the three. Chicken and veal sausages were pretty bland. The dry aged Tomahawk steak for two cost $160! WOW! It was very tender and juicy but not sure if it was worth $160! I wouldn't compare Tomahawk with Peter Luger's Porterhouse. Maybe I have to come back and try the Porterhouse and compare. But in terms of price, this place was definitely at the higher end. The steak came with scallion salad, which was a very Asian thing to have. The grilled mushroom was very good and tasty. At the end, we also had the kimchi fried rice. The fried rice was very yummy and it cooked with bacon bits. However, the fried egg on the top was overcooked. We were super confused about tipping or not tipping as everyone else. Since my coworker was a regular here, we decided to go with the menu suggestion for not tipping. Overall, we paid definitely more than at Peter Luger for a meal for 4.

**[The Capital Grille](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-capital-grille-new-york-3?hrid=N3JDyDmonCTDwWJ5dmnVTw)** is always my go-to place for the restaurant week deals! The services were very good even during the busy days. Make sure to make reservations before the visit. This place tends to get very crowded, especially during lunch. The steak salad was just the right amount that I needed. Plus the dessert, yum! I always get the cheesecake, which is creamy with hard caramel top (similar to a creme brulee). It's definitely something unusual.

**[Robert et Louise](https://www.yelp.com/biz/robert-et-louise-paris-2?hrid=Cz-vSRQg4HRVbyxLax0Deg)** is located in Paris, France. I came here for lunch with my husband, sister in law and a friend. There was a big brick oven / grill in the wall on the first level, where the steaks were cooked. We sat at the downstairs dining area. Steak wasn't too tender but it had a great flavor. Sausages were good with musters. Smoked herring was excellent. We also ordered a bottle of Bordeaux for 20 euro, which was a steal.
