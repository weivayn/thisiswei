Here is my rating of the cheesecakes, which are served as a dessert item, at a restaurant that I had so far in my life:

Steakhouses
==================

No. 1
------------------
**[Peter Luger](http://www.yelp.com/biz/peter-luger-brooklyn-2?hrid=McJ2jzoC3pj1LLedw36Phg)** is the most a New York steakhouse can get. Their porterhouse is definitely out of the world. Cheese cake and Schlag add a great ending to the meal.

------------------
**[The Capital Grille](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-capital-grille-new-york-3?hrid=N3JDyDmonCTDwWJ5dmnVTw)** in FiDi is my top spot for having the restaurant week lunches. The cheesecake is creamy with hard caramel top, which is very similar to a creme brulee. It's definitely something out of the ordinary. Sometimes, the cheesecake comes in different shapes too but always serves with some kind of fruit sauce.

------------------
**[Ben & Jack's Steakhouse](http://www.yelp.com/biz/ben-and-jacks-steakhouse-new-york-2?hrid=g4arKrG3FBQEKGfQ5wvdoQ)** is known for the history with Peter Luger. The steak was definitely well cooked. The cheesecake was little bit gummy, which I felt was weird.

**[Bobby Van's Steakhouse](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bobby-vans-steakhouse-new-york-3?hrid=TlJ_iRuMrLGtgJ_ZnDwDSw)** is another steakhouse in FiDi. I have also been here at least a few times during the restaurant week. I, of course, got the cheesecake as the dessert. However, it wasn't remarkable and memorable.

Diners
==================

No. 1
------------------
**[Brownstone Diner & Pancake Factory](https://www.yelp.com/biz/brownstone-diner-and-pancake-factory-jersey-city?hrid=RcR88cM_m-QZTiOi5yScUw)** was featured on the Food Network show - [Diners, Drive-ins and Dives](http://www.foodnetwork.com/restaurants/nj/jersey-city/brownstone-diner-restaurant). And that was how I found out about this place. We used to drive miles away to come here for breakfast and pancakes. One day, we decided to have a slice of their New York style cheesecake with strawberries and I liked it. It tasted like the vanilla ice cream. It was dense and smooth but not tangy at all.

No. 2
------------------
**[Tops Diner](http://www.yelp.com/biz/tops-diner-east-newark?hrid=_-OXJBHc-wKhKqhaQUY13w)** is supposed to be the best diner in the area. I really wanted to like it. The food that we ordered tasted good except the original cheesecake, which I had to go. I ate it right when I got home. I had only one bit then I had to throw the entire slice away. It had a very nasty fridge taste, which wasn't fresh at all. I supposed that this was the worst cheesecake that I ever had.

Pubs

No. 1
------------------
**[Dorrian's](https://www.yelp.com/biz/dorrians-jersey-city?hrid=5JtTkBlE4MyH8HifjhFyMg)** in Jersey City is my go-to place for fish and chips and bangers and mash. The manager, Kimmy, is extremely friendly and always remembers me. He even offered us free desserts. The cheesecake over here was just okay comparing it to the other great food that they offered.

Buffet
==================

No. 1
------------------
**[Bacchanal Buffet](http://www.yelp.com/biz/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?hrid=2KayeIBhRNPv1c4OoC3j0A)** is one of most famous buffets in Vegas, maybe even in the America. They are known for the quality and variety of items. Yes, their cheesecake is very good. They are light and creamy. You can finish it in just one bite.
